I built this for my girlfriend after she finds flashcards useful for school but couldn't find a tool that worked the way she wanted.

Generate study cards on any topic using AI. Enter a subject, specify how many cards you need, and study with a swipe-based interface.

Try it at [flashcards.solenne.ai](https://flashcards.solenne.ai).

Built with Kotlin Multiplatform, Compose Multiplatform, [Circuit](https://github.com/slackhq/circuit) (Slack's architecture framework), and [Koog](https://github.com/JetBrains/koog) (JetBrains' AI framework). Currently supports Gemini for card generation.
